# Stage 2 Frontend Task: Timbu Cloud Shop

## Study Material
- Learn [React](http://react.dev/learn) and [Next (Js/Ts)](https://nextjs.org/docs)

## Task

In this stage, you'll step outside your individual coding zone and embrace collaboration! Here's the mission:

### Find a Designer:
Partner up with a designer. This is your chance to showcase your communication and teamwork skills.

### Design Implementation:
Collaborate with your designer to bring their Timbu Cloud shop page design to life. Translate the design into a functional webpage using React (.tsx/.jsx) / Next.js (.tsx/.jsx). Make sure there’s a checkout page as well.

### Requirements

- **Collaboration:** Effective communication and teamwork with your assigned designer throughout the development process. (You are only allowed to collaborate with a designer, any collaboration with your fellow FE dev will result in instant disqualification).
  
- **Technologies:** TypeScript or JavaScript.
  
- **Responsiveness:** The website must be responsive and function well on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  
- The shop page should reflect the designer's vision.
  
- Products should be displayed with clear descriptions and images.
  
- A checkout page checkout process should be implemented.
  
- There will be no functional checkout process at this stage.
  
- All static pages must be implemented.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- **Visual Design:** Your implementation must be pixel-perfect and reflect what is on the Figma design (layout, colors, branding).
  
- Products are displayed clearly with descriptions and images.
  
- Navigation allows users to browse through the shop page.
  
- The page is static (no working checkout process).
  
- The page should be fully responsive and adjust to different screen sizes.
  
- **Code Quality:** Well-structured, indented, and easy-to-read jsx/tsx code.

## Submission Mode
